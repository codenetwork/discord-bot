# Code Network Discord Bot

This is the code that runs our official Code Network Discord bot. PRs welcome (see below).

# How to contribute

Our bot is written in python and we've made it easy to make additions. To make it easier
when developing your bot we highly recommend you make a test discord guild. This way you
can test your bot before you make a pull request.

You can suggest new features in the `#suggestions` or `#bot` channels in our discord.
If you want to add a new feature, you should read this entire page. After that you
can make a pull request with any changes.

### Make a test discord server

First off, make a new discord server (also referred to as a Guild). You can do this
from within discord once you're logged in. Click the "+" button on the left side of
the screen below all the current Guilds you've joined.

### Create your test bot

You'll have to make a new discord app, create a bot user then add it to your test guild.

[Click Here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) to make a new discord app.
Name it something like "Joe's Test Guild" and fill in the mandatory fields. Once you've
made a new app, click the "Bot" section button on the left to enter the bot menu.

Make a new bot user. Make note of the token and paste it into the config.json file where it
says "MY_BOT_TOKEN_HERE".

### Add your bot to your test guild

Click the "OAuth2" button on the left to enter the invite url menu. Scroll down to the "scopes" section.
Select the "bot" scope and "Administrator" from the bot permissions section. Copy the URL then open it in
a new window. Select your test guild from the dropdown menu and hit "Authorize". The bot
has now been added to your guild but is not currently running.

### Run your test bot

Because the bot opens a websocket to the discord API, it will run from almost anywhere.
You don't need to setup any webhooks or public endpoints. From the root of this GitHub
repo just run `python3 -m disco.cli --config config.json` to start the bot.

### Test your bot

From within your test guild you should be able to test your bot now. All bot commands
start with "!". The command `!test` should work out of the box. Bear in mind some
of the bot's functionality (like `!role give blah`) is dependant on the guild configuration
and won't work unless your test guild is setup the same as the official Code Network one.
Feel free to post in the `#bot` channel on the official guild if you need any help.

### Adding new functionality and testing your bot

It's best to only add functionality that is actually useful. Pull requests that don't add
anything useful or that are buggy probably won't be accepted. Make sure you thoroughly
test your bot first. Feel free to invite people to your test guild if you need help
testing.
